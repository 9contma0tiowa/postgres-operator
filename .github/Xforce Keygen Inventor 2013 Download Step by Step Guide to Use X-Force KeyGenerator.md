## What is Autodesk Inventor 2013?
 
Autodesk Inventor 2013 is a computer-aided design (CAD) software that allows you to create 3D models of mechanical products and systems. You can use Inventor to design, visualize, simulate, and document your ideas, from concept to manufacturing. Inventor 2013 is part of the Autodesk Product Design Suite, which also includes AutoCAD, AutoCAD Mechanical, AutoCAD Electrical, and other tools for product development.
 
## What are the main features of Autodesk Inventor 2013?
 
Autodesk Inventor 2013 has many features that can help you design better products faster and easier. Some of the main features are:

- Parametric modeling: You can create and edit 3D models based on parameters and constraints that define their shape and size. You can also use equations, tables, and dimensions to control your design.
- Direct editing: You can modify 3D models without using parameters or constraints. You can push, pull, move, rotate, and scale geometry directly on the screen.
- Freeform modeling: You can create organic shapes and complex surfaces using subdivision modeling techniques. You can also convert freeform models into parametric models.
- Multi-CAD translation: You can import and export 3D models from various CAD formats, such as SolidWorks, CATIA, Pro/ENGINEER, NX, and others. You can also work with native DWG files from AutoCAD.
- ShapeManager: You can use Autodesk's proprietary geometric modeling kernel to create and manipulate solid and surface models with high accuracy and performance.
- Design Accelerators: You can use predefined components and calculations to create common mechanical elements, such as gears, shafts, bearings, bolts, springs, and more.
- Frame Generator: You can create structural frames using standard profiles or custom sketches. You can also apply loads and perform static stress analysis on your frames.
- Sheet Metal: You can create sheet metal parts using flanges, bends, cuts, punches, and other features. You can also unfold and document your sheet metal designs.
- Skeletal modeling: You can use 2D sketches or 3D curves to define the basic shape and proportions of your design. You can then derive parts and assemblies from your skeleton model.
- Inventor Studio: You can create photorealistic renderings and animations of your 3D models. You can also apply materials, lighting, cameras, and backgrounds to enhance your presentation.
- iCopy: You can create copies of assemblies that adapt to different sizes and configurations. You can also use iCopy to automate the creation of custom components.
- iLogic: You can use a graphical interface to create rules and parameters that control your design. You can also use iLogic to automate tasks and workflows.

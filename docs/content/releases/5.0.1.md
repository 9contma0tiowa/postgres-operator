## Changes

- The `replicas` value for an instance set must now be greater than `0`, and at least one instance set must now be defined for a `PostgresCluster`.  This is to prevent the cluster from being scaled down to `0` instances, since doing so results in the inability to scale the cluster back up.
- Refreshed the PostgresCluster CRD documentation using the latest version of `crdoc` (`v0.3.0`).
- The PGO test suite now includes a test to validate image pull secrets.

## Fixes

- It is now possible to customize `shared_preload_libraries` when monitoring is enabled.
- Fixed a typo in the description of the `openshift` field in the PostgresCluster CRD.
- When a new cluster is created using an existing PostgresCluster as its dataSource, the original primary for that cluster will now properly initialize as a replica following a switchover. This is fixed with the upgrade to Patroni 2.1.0).
